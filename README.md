# DailyDogs


This application was meant to display my knowledge in fields of iOS development. 
The main idea of the project was to build an application with 2 main screens:
-
1. A list of dog breeds
2. A simple detail view of a each dog breed

The app should also work in offline mode and as a bonus task it should include certain unit tests.
Please keep in mind, that there was no focus on the design-part of the application, so it's kept simple

The API I used for the appplication is https://dog.ceo.

The list of dog breeds:

The detail view of each dog breed, in this case there are no subbreeds available

And this is the detail view with subbreeds to choose
